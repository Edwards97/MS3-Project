# MS3-Project Timeline
### Day 1  
Mostly worked on setting up SQLite environment (watching videos and downloading). Set up first stage of java file to accept .csv file and print contents.  
I've worked around SQL but never with it directly. It's been challenging to learn something entirely new but I figure any exposure is something I can build from to grow.  
### Day 2  
Concentrated on bringing up the JDBC for java and setting up a connection with MySQL. (Got it working too, yay!) Got some given sample code to run and return properly (https://www.tutorialspoint.com/jdbc/jdbc-sample-code.htm) Took too long to fix a simple classpath mistake.  
Altered sample code to also create database.
