# MS3-Project Timeline
### Day 1  
Mostly worked on setting up SQLite environment (watching videos and downloading). Set up first stage of java file to accept .csv file and print contents.  
I've worked around SQL but never with it directly. It's been challenging to learn something entirely new but I figure any exposure is something I can build from to grow.  
### Day 2  
Concentrated on bringing up the JDBC for java and setting up a connection with SQLite. (Got it working too, yay!) Got some given sample code to run and return properly (https://www.tutorialspoint.com/jdbc/jdbc-sample-code.htm) Took too long to fix a simple classpath mistake.  
Altered sample code to also create database.
### Day 3  
Placed jdbc connector in another class to reduce clutter. Made so running also populates databases with table "Columns" listing A through J. Conducted some research about JFrame as it seems to be the common graphical aid to Java applications (https://www.java-made-easy.com/java-jframe.html) and JFrame w/ buttons (https://javatutorial.net/jframe-buttons-listeners-text-fields). Began process of parsing the csv files contents and transposing to a SQLite database.
